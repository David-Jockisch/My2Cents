<h1>David's 2 Cents</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Pros of PS5</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Upgradable storage using off the shelf M.2 SSDs </li>
    <li>Peripheral support (Type C headphones for PS5 also work with PC, Switch)</li>
    <li>PlayStation voice chat is top tier.</li>
    <li>Can play all PS4 titles, some patched to run better (See cons)</li>
    <li>(More Friends on PlayStation!)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Cons of PS5</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Has Discord support but not a built in Discord app.</li>
    <li>Without a storage upgrade, the on board SSD fills up fast. </li>
    <li>Can only play PS1-3 games that have been loaded on the PlayStation store to work. </li>
    <li>Could be a con- New slim PS5 has 2 front USB C ports instead of a type A and C</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Pros of Xbox Series X</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Gamepass is affordable and has a lot of day one games.</li>
    <li>Has built in Discord app to connect to servers from the console.</li>
    <li>Can play any Xbox game from OG Xbox to current gen. Will automatically find the best version of this.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Cons of Xbox Series X</h2>
<ul>
    <li>For 2022/23 Xbox exclusive lineup was lacking. </li>
    <li>Upgradable storage is proprietary and dollar per GB is very high.</li>
    <li>Recent games are releasing with Series X and Xbox One versions. Not sure how the Xbox One version loads on Series X</li>
    <li>Peripheral requires specific hardware. Xbox headphone must be made for Xbox. Might not work on other platforms. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Thoughts on Xbox Series S</h2>
<p>Don't wastes your money or time on this turd. The PS4 has more power.</p>
